# Prompt Aggregation Dataset - Custom Dataset
This dataset is a curated collection of unsafe, adversarial, and sensitive prompts.

##  Overview  
This dataset is a curated collection of unsafe, adversarial, and sensitive prompts designed to support research in LLM safety, prompt injection defense, and content moderation. It aggregates diverse examples from multiple benchmark sources and hackathon experiments, enabling robust evaluation and training of safety filters and classifiers.

##  Structure  
The dataset includes:  
- **Prompt text**: Raw user inputs or adversarial instructions.   
- **Safety labels**: Optional annotations for unsafe/safe/sensitive classification.
